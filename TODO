complete_pdu = true, new_offset = 0
pinfo.desegment_offset=0
pinfo.desegment_len=0
got some extra right here, setting new_offset = 1033
complete_pdu = true, new_offset = 1033
### at this point we want to loop and start at 1033
pinfo.desegment_offset = 1033
complete_pdu = false, new_offset = ...th/devel/wireshark/mqtt/Wireshark-MQTT-Fork/mqtt.lua:250: Range is out of bounds
###
### At this point we want to tell wireshark that:
###   we need more bytes, AND
###   the next PDU should start at 1033
###
### HOWEVER, when this is invoked again, pinfo.desegment_offset is set to 0
### and apparently we are only given the next TCP segment, not the remaining
### part of the previous TCP segment.
###
### HMMMMM, is the function properly returning control to Wireshark at this point???
